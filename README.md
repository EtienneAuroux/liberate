# Flow
A fast-paced game to test how far I can push the dart/c combo. So far only available on Windows.
The game has you follow your mouse pointer to capture targets whilst avoiding incoming enemies, steering clear of blocks, and dodging lasers.

## Access
Flow alpha version 3 can be found on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/EtienneAuroux/liberate/releases/tag/Alpha).
To install, simply download the zip file, unzip, double click on flow.exe.

## Development
Flow is under **active development**. To-do list:
- Complete documentation
- Push code coverage in the high 80%
- Improve c-layer to handle more user interactions and background options.
- Create a story for the game so as to guide the artistic direction.
- Add support for Android, iPhone, and Mac

## Ambition
Have Flow be a difficult game to clear geared toward hard-tryers and speed-runners.
Have Flow be visually appealing while maintaining high performance under the hood.
